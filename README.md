# Knowledge-Base

This knowledge base is intended to simplify the "on-boarding" process for new members of MATLAB Club.

My vision for this student organization is that we will use it as an opportunity to practice technical writing and public speaking, while also building a supportive community which will encourage their fellow students with positive feedback. Hopefully this will inspire everyone to produce cool exercises and tutorials for their classmates to follow.

My eventual goal is that once we've progressed past the basics: there will be some interest in image processing and machine learning topics. 

These are areas where I've dedicated most of my energy as a programmer, and with a few more people interested in them: hopefully we can do some of this sort of Digital Signal Processing as a club.
